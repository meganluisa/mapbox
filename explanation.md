- first test the application myself to see what and where the problem is and compare that to their inquiry
- make sure i am familiar with the task they are trying to accomplish by visiting the doc pages for what they are trying to accomplish. 
review all of the absulute required steps to get the map displayed and check to make sure they completed each step. 
once i ensure they are following all *required* steps, for example, including the CSS script tags, API token, map container height and width properties, etc., 
once the basics are covered, i can research other potential lines of code or parameters that may be causing issues, such as their javascript function that opens the map when the button is clicked, etc.
check if they are using mapbox GL or mapbox.js?
- i made sure to not change as much of their code as possible, which is important because there are often many solutions to one problem, but often times people only send snippets of their code, so by changing their code lots to get a soltuion, you could disturb other parts of their code. For example, the first solution I thought of was defining the div style height to be 200px from the getgo, then the only property that changes is the ...
My approach to the reply was to first give them the solution, then explain as to make them not need to read through lots of tect before getting the answer they wanted.
I wanted to go deeper into how the map and container are two separate objects, which is why the map needs to know when the container changees, but I decided to leave that out to keep the reply concise and direct. HOwever to comprimise, I made sure to let the customer know they should reach out to me with further questions so I could further explain some more HTML or JavaScript concepts that explain what the issue was.
